# Module Browser

The module browser offers an alternative to the built in module browser within VCVRack. It has some weaknesses compared to the built-in browser
but at the same time offers some distinct advantages. Both browsers can be used at the same time.

## Creating Modules

The first three icons allow you to browse for modules by Author, Tag or from the list of Favorites. Use the icon to select the list you require.

### ![](../res/plugin.svg)&nbsp;Authors.

Select an author to be shown a list of the modules available from that author. To go back either select the Authors icon again, or select
the 'Back' option at the top of the list.

Clicking on a module will cause that module to be added to your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible to the 
module browser.

Alternatively you can drag a module from the module browser to anywhere on your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible
to where you tried to drop it.

### ![](../res/tag.svg)&nbsp;Tags

Select a tag to be shown a list of the modules which offer that functionality. To go back either select the Tags icon again, or select
the 'Back' option at the top of the list.

Clicking on a module will cause that module to be added to your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible to the 
module browser.

Alternatively you can drag a module from the module browser to anywhere on your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible
to where you tried to drop it.

### ![](../res/favorite.svg)&nbsp;Favorites

The favorites list is loaded from your settings file. As a result it is normally only updated when you quit VCVRack. Favorites changed during a patching session will not show up in the module browser until the next time that you start VCVRack.

Clicking on a module will cause that module to be added to your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible to the 
module browser.

Alternatively you can drag a module from the module browser to anywhere on your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible
to where you tried to drop it.

## ![](../res/load.svg)&nbsp;Loading Patches

The Disk icon will open up a dialog box allowing you to select either a patch or a preset file. 

### Patch Files

Loading a patch file will cause all the modules in the patch to be imported into your current patch. Everything already in your patch will remain.

The loaded modules will be grouped together in their original arrangement, but placed into your patch somewhere where there is sufficient space for the whole arrangement. All the settings and wiring from your patch will be set-up also. This is an ideal tool for 
building a library of signal chains that you pick and choose from to construct more complex patches.

### Preset Files

Loading a preset file will add a new module from into your patch. It will also be configured with the settings of the preset. This can be quicker than manually adding the module and then opening the preset from within the module to configure it.

## Sizing

### ![](../res/min.svg)&nbsp;Minimize

The Minimize icon will shrink the size of the module browser down to 1-HP. All the modules in the patch to the right of the module browser will be move to the left to take up the space. 

When the module browser is minimized, a Restore button is visible in the centre of the module. Selecting this will restore the module to its previous size. All modules to the right of the module browser will be moved to the right to make space.

In this way you can keep the module browser in your patch for ready access, without taking up more space than is necessary.

When the module browser is in its open state, a drag handle at the right-hand edge can be used to make the module wider or narrower.

### Zooming

The scrolling list in the module browser is designed to remain readable. If you zoom in, the items in the list will increase in size as you might expect, but if you zoom out to less than 100% the items in the list will remain the same size on the screen to ensure that they remain visible.
