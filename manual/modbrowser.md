# Module Browser

The module browser offers an alternative to the built in module browser within VCVRack. It has some weaknesses compared to the built-in browser
but at the same time offers some distinct advantages. Both browsers can be used at the same time.

## Creating Modules

The first three icons allow you to browse for modules by Author, Tag or from the list of Favorites. Use the icon to select the list you require.

### Authors.

Select an author to be shown a list of the modules available from that author. To go back either select the Authors icon again, or select
the 'Back' option at the top of the list.

Clicking on a module will cause that module to be added to your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible to the 
module browser.

Alternatively you can drag a module from the module browser to anywhere on your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible
to where you tried to drop it.

### Tags

Select a tag to be shown a list of the modules which offer that functionality. To go back either select the Tags icon again, or select
the 'Back' option at the top of the list.

Clicking on a module will cause that module to be added to your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible to the 
module browser.

Alternatively you can drag a module from the module browser to anywhere on your patch. The module will be added into empty space as close as possible
to where you tried to drop it.
